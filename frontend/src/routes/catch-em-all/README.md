# Catch 'em all

HTML5 Brick Breaker Game with Pok√©mon theme

This game is an example project to discover HTML5 canvas.
It consists of a local highscore in the top left corner and the main playing area in the middle of the screen.
The player is able to pause the game, reach the final level 10 (hardest level too) or most likely lose all three attempts in the process of achieving the highscore.
