3. Open the browser at `http://localhost:5173`.
4. Make changes to the frontend code and see the changes in the browser.
5. Press `STRG + C` to stop the server.

### Folder Structure

- `static`: Place your static files like images and favicons in here.
- `routes`: Contains the routes of the frontend. Each route is a separate `page.svelte` file and uses svelte lib components.
- `lib`: Contains the source code of the frontend.
  - `api`: Contains api http requests for the corresponding backend endpoints.
  - `components`: Contains the reusable svelte components.
  - `config`: Contains the application configurations.
  - `styles`: Contains the shared style to be used in all svelte components.
  - `types`: Contains the shared types to be used in all svelte components.
  - `util`: Contains the utility functions of the frontend.

### i18n internationalization

The frontend uses the `sveltekit-i18n` library for internationalization. The translations are stored in the `src/lib/config/` folder. The translations are loaded in the `src/lib/util/translations.ts` file. The translations are used in the svelte components with the `t` function. There is also a initialization check with `{#if $initialized}` svelte condition block.

# Deployment

## Automatically

1. Make changes to the frontend code under `/frontend`.
2. Push the changes to the repository `develop` branch.
3. The changes will be automatically deployed to the homelab server.
4. Create pull request from `develop` to `main` branch.

## Manually

1. Build the frontend artifact

```
npm run build
```

2. Deploy the frontend by coping the `dist` folder content to the server in `/home/tilloh/html`.
3. Reload website with Strg + F5.
