and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- [frontend] Self-hosted Londrina Solid Font als globale Schriftart via Fontsource; Carbon CDN-Duplikat entfernt; CSS-Variablen `--font-display` und `--font-mono` eingeführt.
- [docs] Add `docs/` folder with structured feature and shared infrastructure documentation for AI context (20 files: 1 template, 10 feature docs, 9 shared docs).
- [claude] Update commit-push skill to automatically detect and update affected docs before committing, with generic doc-to-source mapping that works across repositories.
- [hitstar] Show current game mode (Classic / Range) as small grey label top-left, only visible during an active game (hidden in the main menu).

### Changed

- [memorandum] Ordner-Erstellung über FAB + Modal statt direkter Erstellung; FAB immer sichtbar; Zero-State öffnet ebenfalls das Modal.
- [jokes] Inline-Witz-Formular durch FAB + Modal ersetzt; Seite zeigt nur noch den Zufallswitz-Bereich.
- [hitstar] Remove Spotify embed (full iframe) from the reveal phase; only round tracker, abort button, flipped track card and next-round button are shown after guessing.
- [hitstar] Spotify track search now uses a single random year (1955–2025) per request instead of a fixed range to improve year distribution across decades.
- [hitstar] Add `genre:pop` filter to Spotify search query to increase the share of well-known tracks.

- [backend] Auto-seed toggles on application startup: missing toggles are created with default values from config; existing toggles are never overwritten.
- [hitstar] Add animated step-card tutorial in the menu that loops through 5 game steps with icons and auto-highlights each card every 2 seconds.
- [hitstar] Multi-mode architecture with Carbon Tabs (horizontal, compact, centered, no dropdown on any viewport) with spacing below for mode selection on the Hitstar start page.
- [hitstar] New "Range" game mode: set a 1–5 year range instead of guessing exactly; narrower ranges earn more points (max 50).
- [hitstar] Replace Spotify iframe embed in guessing phase with Spotify iFrame API: hidden iframe controlled by custom Play/Pause and Replay buttons for a clean, maskless player UI.

### Fixed

- [hitstar] Clicking a game mode tab no longer auto-starts a round; the menu always stays visible after page load or tab switch, and only "New Game" triggers the game.
- [hitstar] Album cover on the track card is now smaller on mobile viewports so all metadata (title, artist, album, year) fits within the card bounds without being clipped.
- [hitstar] Spotify iFrame API player no longer throws PlaybackError after the 30-second preview ends; clicking Play or Replay reloads the track via `loadUri` and starts playback automatically.
- [hitstar] Range mode NumberInput fields now correctly display the default value (2000) by overriding Carbon's oversized `padding-right` that was truncating the 4-digit year.
- [hitstar] CSS selector for Range submit button narrowed from `:global(button)` to `:global(button.bx--btn)` to prevent accidentally resizing the NumberInput stepper buttons.

### Changed

- [hitstar] Refactored Hitstar into shell + separate mode components (HitstarClassic, HitstarRange) with shared sub-components (HitstarRoundTracker, HitstarGameTopBar, HitstarLoadingScreen, HitstarResultsScreen).
- [hitstar] Refactored localStorage keys to mode-specific pattern (hitstar.classic.*, hitstar.range.*) with automatic migration of existing data.
- [hitstar] Hide best-score tile in menu when no score has been recorded yet.
- [hitstar] Replace static ProgressIndicator with custom icon step-cards (Headphones, Calendar, CheckmarkFilled, Repeat, Trophy) for the game tutorial.
- [hitstar] New "Hitstar" music year guessing game: listen to a 30-second preview and guess the release year across 10 rounds.
- [hitstar] Renamed backend NX library `spotify` to `hitstar`; endpoint changed from `GET /spotify/random-track` to `GET /hitstar/random-track`.
- [hitstar] Frontend route `/hitstar` with state machine (MENU → LOADING → GUESSING → REVEAL → RESULTS).
- [hitstar] Audio preview plays automatically in GUESSING state via iTunes preview URL.
- [hitstar] CSS 3D flip card animation on answer reveal, confetti for correct guesses, shake animation for wrong answers.
- [hitstar] Links to search on Spotify and open on Apple Music shown after reveal.
- [hitstar] Best score and active game state persisted in localStorage; interrupted games can be resumed.
- [hitstar] Abort button to cancel the current game at any time.

### Changed

- [hitstar] Reworked results screen with top/middle/bottom layout, colored per-round indicator squares (green/red), left border on result tiles, and removed score headline and Spotify/Apple Music links.
- [hitstar] Card border and year color now signal correct (green glow) or wrong (red glow) answer in reveal state; neutral border uses modern semi-transparent style.
- [hitstar] Shake animation on wrong answer moved from guessing screen to the card in reveal state.
- [hitstar] Switched backend track search from iTunes to Spotify API with OAuth2 client credentials token caching, market=DE filter, and `q=* year:1950-2025` query.
- [hitstar] Refactored GUESSING/REVEAL layout into top/middle/bottom sections: headline+exit+tracker pinned to top, card+audio centered vertically, year input pinned to bottom.
- [hitstar] Made HitstarCard fully responsive using `min()` and `aspect-ratio` instead of fixed pixel dimensions.
- [hitstar] Improved mobile layout: no horizontal or vertical scrollbars; components scale smaller on small screens.
- [frontend] Replaced `overflow: auto` on `main` with `overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: auto` to prevent horizontal scrollbars.
- [jokes] Removed fixed height and margin from jokes container to avoid unwanted scroll areas.
- [global] Reduced GlobalMenu font sizes on mobile for better fit.
- [hitstar] Redesigned GUESSING/REVEAL UI: question headline + small danger Exit icon button in top bar, round progress tracker (gray/green/red bars), year input and submit icon button inline, submit icon centered via flex override.
- [global] Claude Code `/commit-push` Skill für automatisierten Commit-und-Push-Workflow.
- [global] Post-Commit Hook erweitert mit Unicode-Gitmojis und zusätzlichen Keywords (test, style, update, improve, move, breaking, access, database, responsive, animation, i18n, clean).

- [memorandum] Empty state redesigned as Carbon Tile cards with title, description, and CTA buttons.
- [memorandum] FAB add-folder button is now `kind="primary"` and hidden in empty state.

- [todo] Edit button (pencil icon) added to Todo items on mobile as alternative to right-click ContextMenu.

### Fixed

- [memorandum] Race condition in cloud storage mode: subscribe handler now skips writes during initialization (`isInitialized` guard) to prevent overwriting server data with the empty default preset.
- [memorandum] `refreshPresetStore` was called twice on page mount (once via IIFE, once via `onMount`), causing duplicate concurrent loads and additional race conditions.
- [memorandum] Replaced Empty State flash during cloud data loading with Carbon skeleton cards, preventing the user from accidentally interacting with the empty-state buttons before data has loaded.

- [food-scan] `ContentOutput` image preview and text output use `max-width: 100%` on phone (were too narrow at 33vw/50vw).
- [food-scan] `DebugInformation` stats table is wrapped in `overflow-x: auto` to prevent horizontal overflow on mobile.

- [todo] `GenericListOverlay` delete button has `min-height/min-width: 44px` on phone.
- [todo] `Todo.svelte` title and category inputs have `font-size: 16px` on phone to prevent iOS Safari auto-zoom.
- [todo] Tab autocomplete hint hidden on phone (`display: none`) since mobile keyboards lack a Tab key.
- [settings] `OnlinePersistenceCheck` edit connection form wraps on phone so TextInput stacks above the button.
- [todo] Empty state button group (Neue Liste / Liste importieren) wraps on phone with `flex-wrap: wrap`.
- [global] All `height: Xvh` declarations now use double-declaration `Xvh; Xdvh` pattern for iOS Safari dynamic toolbar compatibility (`+layout.svelte`, `uno-sort`, `Jokes.svelte`, `AboutInfo.svelte`, `ToggledApplicationInfo.svelte`).
- [global] Background gradient `background-size` uses `100dvh` fallback so it covers the full dynamic viewport on iOS.

### Removed

- [home] Navigation margin-bottom reduced to `1rem` on phone/tablet (was 4rem/2rem).

### Fixed

- [frontend] Fixed `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'de')` by replacing the non-reactive Proxy in `applications.ts` with a Svelte writable store initialized with proper default route values. All consumer components updated to use reactive store access (`$applicationRoutes`).

### Added

- [todo] Categories are now normalized (trimmed + lowercased) on write and on app start, so "Arbeit", "ARBEIT" and "arbeit" all map to "arbeit".
